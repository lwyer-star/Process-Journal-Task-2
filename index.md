# Week 6 — First Entry
…your content…


Welcome to my process journal for **DES222 Task 2**.  
This will document my steps, experiments, and reflections as I work through responsive technology design.

## Responsive Roulette Ideas

### Idea 1: Urban Space + Sensors + Sound
An interactive sound installation at a bus stop that plays tones based on people’s movements.

### Idea 2: Wearable + Weather Data + Haptics
A bracelet that vibrates to warn of upcoming storms using live weather API.

### Idea 3: Gallery Space + Cameras + Projection
Visitors’ shadows morph into generative art projected on the walls.

## Reflection
This week I successfully set up my process journal using GitHub Pages.  
I practiced adding text in Markdown, embedding an image, and linking a YouTube video.  
I also experimented with **Responsive Roulette** to spark project ideas.
