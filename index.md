## About this journal
“My DES222 responsive technology journey from concept to prototype what I tried, what worked and why.”

This site documents my DES222 Task 2 process from early ideation through to a working prototype. Each week includes artefacts (mind map, brainstorms, sketches, tests) and short reflections on decisions made.
