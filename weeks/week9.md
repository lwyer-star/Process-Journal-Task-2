# Week 9 – Oral draft & reflection

## Slide outline (10 minutes)

1. **Title** — Adaptive Senses, provocation: Responding to the World, my name.
2. **Context & Problem** — Heat stress for animals + humans, visibility of risk.
3. **Research & Inspiration** — Related works in wearables, responsive design.
4. **Concept Statement** — Harness sensing environment, translating into UI state messages.
5. **Design Process — Ideation** — Sketches, harness placement, comfort/airflow, initial warning concepts.
6. **Design Process — Prototyping** — Conceptual sketches, logic flow (input → processing → output as UI state message).
7. **Design Process — Testing** — Planned low-fidelity harness prototypes, comfort/movement/visibility testing, peer feedback.
8. **Next Steps** — Materials exploration, refining sketches, structured feedback loops, Task 3 link.
9. **Broader Impact** — Animal welfare focus, ethical framing, new responsive technology possibilities.
10. **Closing & Q&A** — Key takeaway, intended impact.

## Script (draft, ~1000–1200 words)

- **Slide 1 — Title**  
“Hello, my project is called *Adaptive Senses*. It responds to the provocation *Responding to the World*. My name is Liam Wyer.”

- **Slide 2 — Context & Problem**  
“Heat stress is a growing issue for both animals and humans. Dogs in particular are vulnerable when exercising in hot or humid conditions, and owners often miss early signs until it’s too late. The problem is not the lack of data, but the lack of clear, timely signals that people can respond to in motion.”

- **Slide 3 — Research & Inspiration**  
“I researched wearables and responsive design. Devices like the Apple Watch demonstrate how physiological data can be surfaced in simple, glanceable ways. Design precedents also show the importance of keeping attention in the environment rather than locked to a dashboard.”

- **Slide 4 — Concept Statement**  
“My concept is *Adaptive Senses*: a harness that senses environmental stress like heat or poor air quality, and translates this into simple, clear UI state messages on the owner’s phone. Instead of overwhelming data, it gives one short recommendation that the body can act on immediately.”

- **Slide 5 — Design Process: Ideation**  
“I began with sketches exploring harness placement and form. The chest mount emerged as optimal, because it’s close to the core and allows airflow, but it raised comfort concerns — rubbing, breathing, overheating. I tested multiple variations. I also sketched warning concepts: a digital state message on the phone as the central idea, with possibilities like light signals as alternatives. These sketches mapped possibilities and helped me test them against concerns like comfort, visibility, and ease of use.”

- **Slide 6 — Design Process: Prototyping**  
“At this stage, prototyping was conceptual rather than physical. I used sketches and diagrams to explore the system logic. One prototype sketch shows heat being detected at the chest and then translated into a UI state message on the phone. Another focuses on the logic flow: input from the environment, processing by the harness, and output as a glanceable recommendation. These drawings allowed me to shift from an abstract idea to a functional flow I could refine later.”

- **Slide 7 — Design Process: Testing**  
“Physical testing hasn’t yet been carried out, but I’ve planned the process. I will start with low-fidelity prototypes by adapting an existing harness with mock-up elements. These don’t need to be functional yet — the goal is to test scale, weight distribution, and comfort. Feedback will focus on three areas: comfort, movement, and visibility. Comfort ensures the harness isn’t restrictive or irritating. Movement testing checks how it behaves during walking and running. Visibility testing checks whether the warning signals — like UI state messages or optional light cues — are clear to owners in different environments.”

- **Slide 8 — Next Steps**  
“The next stage is refining sketches and exploring materials. Breathable fabrics, reflective tapes, and colour-changing elements are all under consideration. The UI state message system will be central, while light or haptic cues may serve as supplementary. I’ll build low-fidelity prototypes to check comfort and visibility, and then seek structured feedback from peers and tutors to refine both the technical and ethical framing.”

- **Slide 9 — Broader Impact**  
“This project is framed around animal welfare. By combining responsive design with wearables, it explores new ways technology can keep pets safe while running with their owners. At the same time, it raises broader questions about how micro-advice systems could reduce risk without collecting or storing personal data. The focus is on privacy, clarity, and wellbeing.”

- **Slide 10 — Closing & Q&A**  
“In closing, *Adaptive Senses* responds to the world by making hidden environmental risks visible in real time. Its impact lies in translating data into clear, actionable signals that protect both humans and animals. Thank you, and I welcome your questions.”

## Reflection

The oral presentation matches my process journal by following the same stages: ideation, prototyping and testing. It incorporates the corrected terminology of UI state messages The script also aligns with my PowerPoint slides. For feedback, I’ll seek advice on  clarity of the transitions between design stages and whether the balance between technical and ethical considerations comes through strongly.
