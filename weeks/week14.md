# Week 14 — Final showreel and submission

I produced a 1–3 minute video that works standalone for a portfolio viewer: what the project is, who it’s for, how it responds, and why the design choices matter.

## Video outline (shot list)

1. Title card — “Glanceable Heat/Air Run Helper (human + dog)” (2–3 s)  
2. Problem setup — short VO over footage: *“On hot or smoky days… we need quick, safe decisions.”*  
3. UI demo — chip → expand → one action (screen capture or phone close-up)  
4. Physical mirror — LED colours on the harness (Good/Amber/Red)  
5. In-motion test — walking/jogging shots; show transitions  
6. Benefits — clear, calm decisions; privacy-first; on-dog glanceable feedback  
7. Credits — your name, course, tools; “unlisted on YouTube” link in journal

## Script beats (≈120–150 words)

- Concept: “A glanceable helper for runners with dogs. It condenses local temperature and CO₂/air into a simple chip: Good, Shorten, or Slow + water.”  
- Interaction: “Tap to see why and one action—no dashboards.”  
- Hardware: “An ESP32 in a soft-edged chest mount mirrors the state with a single LED—solid colours only.”  
- Design: “Safety and comfort first; privacy by design; conservative thresholds tuned in field tests.”  
- Outcome: “It reduced guesswork and kept attention on the path and the dog.”
