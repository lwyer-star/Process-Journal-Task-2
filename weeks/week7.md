# Week 7 — Related works & research

## Landscape scan
1. **Crowd heatmaps in running apps** — pattern for time/zone-based density; informs my anonymous “busy time” idea.  
2. **Pet wearables (general)** — mostly health logging; my pivot is **shared, in-moment guidance**.  
3. **Weather/AQI risk guidance** — informs thresholds and copy for alerts.

## What I’m taking forward
- **Interaction patterns:** glanceable banners, progressive disclosure.  
- **Tech:** Web Geolocation; Weather/AQI API; basic risk scoring.  
- **Human/cultural:** accessibility (clear language), privacy (no trails/IDs), animal welfare.

## References
- Add your links here (site names, authors, year). Keep brief for now.

## Reflection
The strongest leverage is timely, clear micro-advice rather than dashboards. Privacy needs to be strict to avoid creepiness; aggregation + k-anonymity feels right.
